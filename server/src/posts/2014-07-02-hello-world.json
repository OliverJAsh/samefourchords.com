I have no real idea when I’m going to be back from my travels. I’ll be sad to leave the Guardian, and even sadder to cease collaborating with the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theefer\">truly</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/patrickhamann\">brilliant</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mattpointblank\">bunch</a> of people who work there – more on this in a future post. But I have 100 reasons to go, and just one reason to stay.</p><p>I made this website as a place to host my future ramblings. My family – or more specifically, my mother – have always complained they could not understand the jargon they stalkinglyish (that’s a word, right?) found on neither my Twitter profile nor <a href=\"http://oliverjash.me/\">my other blog</a>. Mum, the insignificant brain dump that awaits is all for you!</p><p>The name of this blog – Same Four Chords – derives from lyrics in a favourite song of mine:</p><blockquote><p>﻿Sometimes it feels like everything’s been done before,<br><i>The same ideas and the same four chords</i>.<br>But we’re still leaving in the morning for to cross the sea,<br>Because not everything’s been done by me.</p></blockquote><p>– <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/as-the-crow-flies/id691163444?i=691163518\">As the Crow Flies</a> by <a href=\"http://willvarley.com/\">Will Varley</a></p><p>I know what you’re thinking: Won’t he miss <a href=\"http://instagram.com/p/l26Btjyw6n\">his dog</a>? Won’t he miss his family? Stay tuned to find out which of these will be first to inevitably bring me home. I’m betting it’s the dog.</p>"
